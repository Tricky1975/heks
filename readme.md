# Heks


Heks is just a very simplistic HEX viewer written in C.

I had no serious plans for this project whatsoever, I just wanted to see if I could do this properly. I am quite a programmer I know but C is alway something that was hard for me to master, so that's why I sometimes do simple projects still in C, just to "challenge" myself.



The word "Heks" means "Witch" in Dutch and is pronounced the same as "hex", well hence the name of this silly project :-P
